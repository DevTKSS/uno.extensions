# Storage

Uno.Extensions.Storage facilitate local data storage across multiple platforms, including WebAssembly, Android, iOS, macOS, Desktop and Windows. This extension is particularly useful for applications that require secure, persistent storage of user preferences, configuration settings, and sensitive information such as tokens and credentials. Additionally, it enables to provide a `ISerializer` from [Uno.Extensions.Serialization](xref:Uno.Extensions.Serialization.Overview) so can get back directly the corresponding deserialized Type your code needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Apple platforms (iOS, Mac Catalyst) the Uno storage extension, used by the authentication extension, uses the OS Key Chain service to store secrets. This requires your application to have the [proper entitlements](xref:Uno.Extensions.Storage.HowToRequiredEntitlements) to work properly.

## Which files could be preferred to use Storage instead of `appsettings.json` via `IConfiguration`

As simple as it sounds, you can use the Storage feature to read and write files (*almost*) independent of their type, while `appsettings.json` is a JSON file that is used to store application settings and configuration data.

> [!TIP]
> Here is a rule for Storage Package files to remember:
>
> As long as you can provide a [ISerializer](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.extensions/blob/main/src/Uno.Extensions.Serialization/ISerializer.cs) or your file is generally readable as <see langword="string"/> or <see cref="Stream"/>, this can be handled with Uno.Extensions.Storage.
> [!NOTE]
> Keep in mind, that for other files you might have their BuildAction property set to Resources or Content, you only need to call them via `ms-appx:Here/comes/your/filepath.txt` for example to get the file from the package.

### Classic file types to use with Storage

- .txt -> simply get the content as a <see langword="string"/>
- .xml -> could be Serialized/Deserialized with an appropriate `XmlSerializer`
- .json -> could be Serialized/Deserialized by using the `Uno.Extensions.Serialization` Extension
- .csv -> could be Serialized/Deserialized with an appropriate `CsvSerializer`

### Useful additional Serializer Libraries for more special files

- .docx/.xlsx
  - `OpenXML`
  - SyncFusion (all payed)
    - [Word Framework](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/word-framework/winui)
    - [Excel Framework](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/excel-framework/winui)
    - [PowerPoint Framework](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/presentation-framework/winui)
- .pdf
  - [PdfPig (Free & Open Source)](https://github.com/UglyToad/PdfPig)
  - [PDFsharp (Free & Open Source, payed advanced support)](https://pdfsharp.com/)
  - [SyncFusion (Payed)](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/pdf-framework/winui) this has many capabilities, which might make you consider using it either way, if you use the MAUI Embedding feature in .NET 8 Uno Apps.

### File types you can not use Storage for

**Binary files like:**

- .exe
- .dll

**Compressed files like:**

- .zip
- .tar
- .gz

*They have to be extracted before usage*

Multimedia files like:

- .mp3
- .mp4
- .jpg
- .png
- .gif

> [!TIP]
> You can handle Image files like .png and .svg via [***Uno.Resizetizer***](xref:Uno.Resizetizer.GettingStarted), which is present in every Uno Project by default.
